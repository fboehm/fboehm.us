<p>Tomorrow my lab will participate in <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/">#ShutDownAcademia #ShutDownSTEM</a>.
I’ll stay at home instead of
traveling to my office. And instead of doing my usual research, I’ll read, watch,
and listen to pieces listed on the organizers’ website: <a href="https://www.shutdownstem.com/" class="uri">https://www.shutdownstem.com/</a>.</p>
<p>I hope that you’ll join me in participating.</p>

<p>CRAN now hosts the packages <code>qtl2pleio</code> and <code>gemma2</code>. <code>qtl2pleio</code> performs a d-variate, d-QTL scan over a select genomic region. <code>gemma2</code> is used by <code>qtl2pleio</code> for the inference of multivariate variance components.</p>
<p>They can be installed with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;qtl2pleio&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The statistical model that <code>qtl2pleio</code> fits for each d-tuple of markers (or pseudomarkers) is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
vec(Y) = Xvec(B) + vec(G) + vec(E)
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a n by d matrix of d traits (for each of n subjects), X is a dn by df block-diagonal matrix of founder allele probabilities, B is a f by d matrix of allele effects for each of d traits, G is a n by d matrix of polygenic random effects, and E is a n by d matrix of random errors. We assume that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
G \sim N(0, K, V_g)
\]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E \sim N(0, I, V_e)
\]</span></p>
<p>We further assume that <span class="math inline">\(V_g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_e\)</span> are independent. <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is an estimated kinship matrix.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.g3journal.org/content/9/7/2317">recent G3 article</a>, we developed
our test of pleiotropy vs. separate QTL and applied it to two behavioral traits
measured on a cohort of Diversity Outbred mice.</p>
<p><code>qtl2pleio</code> “plays nicely” with <a href="https://kbroman.org/qtl2/"><code>qtl2</code></a> and other R packages from the <code>qtl2</code> ecosystem by using the same structures for genotype data, phenotype data, and covariates.</p>
<p>We’re currently investigating our pleiotropy test in the context of expression trait hotspots.</p>

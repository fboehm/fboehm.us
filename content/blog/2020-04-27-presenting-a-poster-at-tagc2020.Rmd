I have the opportunity to present a [poster](https://tagc2020.figshare.com/articles/Enhancing_QTL_detection_power_in_multiparental_populations/12142350) at The Allied Genetics 
Conference (TAGC) 2020. I've posted both a pdf of the poster and a 
mp4 narrated video tour of the poster 
[here](https://tagc2020.figshare.com/articles/Enhancing_QTL_detection_power_in_multiparental_populations/12142350). 

I'd love to address your questions and hear your suggestions in the Q & A session on **Thursday, April 30, at 1:30pm Eastern Time**. 
My poster number is **1333A**.

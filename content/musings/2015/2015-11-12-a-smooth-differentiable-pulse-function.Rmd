This function feeds a high-amplitude sine function through a logit, offsetting so
as to have the pulse start and stop at arbitrary times.  It has an integral of
one per period for large $L$.

$$f(t) = \frac{c}{a - b}
  \frac{1}{1 + e^{L \left(sin(2\pi((t-a)/c + \xi)) - sin(2\pi\xi)\right)}
}$$

where

$$\begin{aligned}
t &= \text{time} \\
a &= \text{time at start of pulse} \\
b &= \text{time at end of pulse} \\
c &= \text{period length} \\
a &< b < c \\
L &= \text{an arbitrarily large number} \\
\xi &= \frac{3}{4} - \frac{b - a}{2c} \\
\end{aligned}$$ 

```{r, cache = TRUE}
smooth_pulse = function(time, start, stop, cycle = 1,  steep = 1000) {
  xi = 3/4 - (stop - start)/(2* cycle)
  (cycle / (stop - start)) / 
    (1 + exp(steep*(sin(2*pi*((time - start)/cycle + xi)) - sin(2*pi*xi))))
}

x = seq(0,5,by=0.001)
plot(x, smooth_pulse(x, start = 0.2, stop = 0.3, cycle = 0.5), xlim = c(0,2),
     type = "l", xlab = "t", ylab = "f(t)",
     main = "a = 0.2, b = 0.3, c = 0.5, L = 1000")

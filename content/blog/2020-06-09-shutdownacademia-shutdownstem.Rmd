Tomorrow my lab will participate in [#ShutDownAcademia #ShutDownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com/). 
I'll stay at home instead of
traveling to my office. And instead of doing my usual research, I'll read, watch,
and listen to pieces listed on the organizers' website: https://www.shutdownstem.com/.

I hope that you'll join me in participating.

# Overview

I maintain two R packages, [qtl2pleio](qtl2pleio) and [gemma2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gemma2/index.html). Both packages are on CRAN. You can install them with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("gemma2", "qtl2pleio"))
```

`gemma2` implements GEMMA's expectation-maximization algorithm for multivariate random 
effects. It doesn't intend to implement all features of GEMMA. Instead, it is a minor 
utility package that `qtl2pleio` requires.

`qtl2pleio` is part of the [`qtl2`](https://kbroman.org/qtl2/) ecosystem of R packages 
for analysis of systems genetics studies. `qtl2pleio` performs a multivariate, multi-QTL 
scan of a chromosome region and tests for presence of multiple QTL. More details and 
vignettes are found on [its `pkgdown` site](qtl2pleio)

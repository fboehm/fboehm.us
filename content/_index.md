Welcome to my website!  I'm a postdoctoral researcher and biostatistician at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. My research is in statistical methods for systems genetics. My colleagues and I use mice to study biology of complex traits, like body weight, that are affected by many genes and other factors. We design and perform experiments to map quantitative trait loci (QTL). In other words, we identify where in the genome are genes that affect a given complex trait.
